				In October 2013, the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) opened its innovative, Job Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Columbia. Located at the corner of Broad River and Shivers Roads and developed in collaboration with community partners, the facility will provide life and job skills classes to DJJ youth on probation, parole, or in committed status ranging primarily from ages 12 to 18, and other youth as part of the agency's prevention and intervention efforts.
